# MLOps

## Project setup

### Pre-Commit

This project uses precommit for linting and formatting the code before it is actively committed to the project.
This helps to ensure code quality and code readability.

To install pre-commit, the following command can simply be run in the terminal.

```
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
```

In the root directory of the project there is a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in which the pre-commit is configured.

In order for the pre commit hooks to be executed automatically before each commit, the following command must be executed in the terminal.

```
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```
